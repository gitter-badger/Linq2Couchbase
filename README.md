Linq2Couchbase
==================

The official Language Integrated Query (LINQ) provider for querying Couchbase Server 4.0 with [N1QL](http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.0/n1ql/n1ql-intro/data-access-using-n1ql.html) using the Couchbase .NET SDK. The goal of Linq2Couchbase is to create a lightweight ORM/ODM for querying Couchbase Buckets using LINQ as the lingua-franca between your application and Couchbase Server 4.0 using N1QL, a SQL-like query language for JSON documents. It also provides a write API for performing CRUD operations on JSON documents.

##Getting started##
The Linq2Couchbase project has the following dependencies:

- Couchbase Server 4.0 or greater with the query service enabled on at least one node
- Couchbase .NET SDK 2.2.0 or greater
- Common.Logging 3.3.0 or greater
- Common.Logging.Core 3.3.0 or greater
- JSON.NET 7.0.1 or greater
- re-linq 1.15.15.0 (re-linq 2.0 is not currently supported!)

If you are using NuGet, then the dependencies (other than Couchbase server) will be installed for you via the package manager. 

###Installing Couchbase Server###
For a single instance of Couchbase server running on localhost, you can download one [here](http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/downloads) (make sure it's 4.0). If you would like to create a cluster, the easiest way is by using the Vagrant scripts for provisioning clusters can be found [here](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/vagrants). Additionally, Docker scripts can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/couchbase/server/). Following the directions on each respective link for installation information.

###Installing the package using NuGet###
Once you have a Couchbase Server 4.0 instance or cluster setup, open Visual Studio 13 or greater or [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/) and create an MVC Web Application. Open the NuGet Package Manager and search for "Couchbase Linq" or type the following into the Package Manager console:

    Install-Package Linq2Couchbase 

NuGet will install the package and all dependencies. Once you have the resolved the dependencies, you will initialize a ClusterHelper object which will manage the bucket resources needed by the Linq provider.
